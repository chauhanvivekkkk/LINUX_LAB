# **EXPERIMENT 1** 
## *Installation of VirtualBox and Setting up linux OS*
---
## ðŸ“Œ Aim  
To install **Oracle VirtualBox** on a Windows system and set up a Linux operating system (Ubuntu/Fedora/etc.) to practice Linux commands and explore its environment in a virtual machine.

---
## ðŸ›  Tools & Software Used  
- **Host OS:** Windows 11
- **Virtualization Software:** Oracle VirtualBox *v7.2.0*
- **Guest OS:** Ubuntu 24.04.03
